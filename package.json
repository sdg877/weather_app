  "description": "This is a simple weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches weather data from an API and displays the current weather conditions, a 7-day forecast, and a 24-hour forecast using the user's location. This project was built following a code-along tutorial to practice and enhance my skills. I adapted it to allow the user to search by postcode.",
